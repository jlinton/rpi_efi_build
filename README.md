This repo has two scripts for cloning and building the edk2 port for the rpi4. The first is build_cross_rpi which will cross build the firmware which can be copied to the SD/etc on the rpi. The second is a script for building a debug version of the trusted-firmware-a binary used/linked to the uefi image. The TFA build isn't absolutly required as the edk2-non-osi repo will contain a pre-built version.  The build_cross_rpi when passed setup_repo will clone and prepare the repos in question in the directory its run from. In both cases the top of the scripts have fairly long blurbs describing their use. Also in both cases they are fairly simple and can be easily hacked to tweak their behavior. The third file here is a copy of my config.txt and the only piece not either provided by these build scripts or the RPi repos (https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot). This is for use by linux (fedora mostly) based developers, with the PFTF release builds handy if there are any questions about where/how files are placed on the SD/etc boot devices.

For users of aarch64 hardware, native builds can be accomplished by commenting out the cross compiler enviroment vars.
